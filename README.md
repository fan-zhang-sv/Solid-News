## Intention for building this app

Growing up in mainland China, and now moved to the US, I found that after constantly receiving information from one source or the same political campaign, people may show less empathy towards views from other campaigns. And this informational vicious circle has worsened the relationships between many countries/areas.

Thus, I'd love to build this app to help to bridge the gap between countries/areas by providing an aggregator that one can see news articles from other countries/areas on the same topic. And knowing how others think would help us to better understand the inter-entity relationship and how to maintain it.

# Functionality

This app is based on Flutter, and has four main sections.

## Top News

The top news section provides latest top news from a specific country so far. The plan is to provides relative news from other countries/areas attached under each news.

## Search

The search section lets you search for a topic, and retrive a list of news, and then user get to choose up to two other countries (due to api limit), and tap the globe button to see relative news.
